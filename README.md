# Breaking Bad

I just copied the Catppuccin theme and changed the colors. I have no idea how to make good themes. Hopefully someone will do this at some point, but until then.

### How

I used the breaking bad colors from my neovim config and asked chatgpt to recolor the catppuccin theme with them and then replaced the colors using `sed`.
